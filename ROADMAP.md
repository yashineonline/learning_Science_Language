# LangAz Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the stages of development for the language (langAz) learning platform.

---

## ✅ Phase 1: Text-Based MVP (Now)

- [x] Generate tri/quadrilingual sentence packs per topic
- [x] Create sentence templates using GPT-4o-mini
- [x] Package output in expandable format (e.g., JSON or Markdown)
- [x] Organize by topic, not grammar level
- [x] Make first 5–10 core lessons (driving, digestion, dishes, helping, daily habits)

---

## 🚧 Phase 2: Interactive Text Reader

- [ ] Build Streamlit UI to:
  - Select topic
  - View sentence in 4 langs + English
  - Click to expand: grammar, pronunciation tips, word-by-word
- [ ] Add search/filter by theme or keyword

---

## 🧠 Phase 3: Learning Engine

- [ ] Add SRS-style review of most common structures
- [ ] Track what learners open or explore more (interest-driven flow)
- [ ] Light recommendation system for next topic
- [ ] Collect common confusions to improve hint generation

---

## 🔊 Phase 4: Multimodal Expansion (Future)

- [ ] Add optional TTS using open models (Bark, Coqui, etc.)
- [ ] Add slow-speech video for native sentence variants
- [ ] Add visual prompts (sketches of situations)

---

## 🧪 Phase 5: Scientific Curriculum Growth

- [ ] Expand daily life topics into scientific reasoning (in friendly terms)
- [ ] Example: Cooking = digestion = enzyme = “eat fruits before rice”
- [ ] Traffic = momentum = "truck slows slower than bicycle"
- [ ] Tie in emotional & cognitive science: hormones, empathy, etc.
- [ ] Introduce fun concepts: energy, time, music, memory, colors, water

---

## 🌍 Phase 6: Agentic AI + Community

- [ ] Allow user to chat with agent to generate topic packs on demand
- [ ] Support user-generated packs and vocabulary collections
- [ ] Add community feedback + voting for best content
- [ ] API to embed packs elsewhere

---

## 🏁 Vision

To create the world’s most human-friendly, joyful, curiosity-driven, multilingual learning experience — one that quietly teaches science and life wisdom while unlocking new languages, cultures, and emotional clarity.
